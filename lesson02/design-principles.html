          Hick's Law states that the more options that one has available to
          them, the longer it takes them to process and act. Google's search
          pages (particularly the image search) are great examples of this. The
          page has a focused purpose, to get user input of what to search for.
          The interface does not include instructions, options, extra fields,
          etc. Other content/information is pushed to the very top and very
          bottom of the page, giving priority to the few elements on the main
          area of the page.

          The Rule of Thirds identifies a tic-tac-toe grid line that when
          overlayed over a viewable pane (picture, layout, etc.) divides it into
          sightlines. A rough grid was overlayed on REI's mobile homepage,
          illustrating the guiding lines of the layout, corresponding to the
          rule of thirds grid. This creates intuitive 'view areas' that a user
          can process more easily.

        <p class="p_block">
          Contrast in a design is a powerful way to emphasize a particular
          element and call attention to it. Netflix uses this principle in many
          ways throughout their brand. Their logo is bright red on a black
          background, 'Recently Added' overlays on new content call the user's
          attention to those options, and thumbnails for content are selected to
          emphasize the image and/or title. These are contrasted agains a plain
          black background, and white clear headers, making the content stand
          out over the page itself.
