        <h2>Moroni 10:32</h2>
        <p>
          Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of
          all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness,
          and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace
          sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ; and
          if by the grace of God ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny
          the power of God.

        <h2>Moroni 10:33</h2>
        <p>
          And again, if ye by the grace of God are perfect in Christ, and deny
          not his power, then are ye sanctified in Christ by the grace of God,
          through the shedding of the blood of Christ, which is in the covenant
          of the Father unto the remission of your sins, that ye become holy,
          without spot.
